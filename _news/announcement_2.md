I’ve just published a blog post exploring how LlamaParse and Multimodal LLMs allow us to extract insights from complex PDFs containing both text and images. 📄✨ <br />

In the post, I walk through: <br />
<ul>
    <li>🔍 Parsing documents with both text and images</li>
    <li>🤖 Using GPT-4V to interpret and query the parsed content</li>
    <li>📊 An example: analyzing U.S. election results from 2016 and 2020.</li>
</ul>

Intelligent PDF parsing + multimodal LLMs are really mighty for document processing, allowing us to handle even more than just plain text—like images, charts, equations, ... 🚀<br />
