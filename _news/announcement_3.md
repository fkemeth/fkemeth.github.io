I’m happy to share the launch of SafePlates, an AI-powered recipe assistant that helps create personalized, allergen-safe meals. 🌱🍽️

Built with OpenAI GPT-4 and using Langchain/LangGraph, SafePlates checks for allergens and suggests safe alternatives. It also features an easy-to-use Gradio interface and is now available on Hugging Face Spaces.

Check it out on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/felixkemeth/safeplates)! It's free and open-source! 💻
