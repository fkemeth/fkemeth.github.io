I’ve launched **Akribic**, a new blog focused on hands-on AI automation workflows.  

On [Akribic](https://www.akribic.com), I share step-by-step breakdowns of real automations, concrete configs and snippets you can reuse, and honest notes on what actually works (and what doesn’t) when building AI-powered workflows in practice.  

You can check it out here: [https://www.akribic.com](https://www.akribic.com).
