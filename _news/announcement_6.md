I’ve published a new article, **“How I built my own fully-automated weekly news digest - here is how you can do that too.”**, where I walk through how to build an AI-powered newsletter workflow in n8n.  

The workflow pulls fresh articles via **NewsAPI**, uses **OpenAI GPT-5.1** to select the 5 most relevant ones, enriches them with **Tavily Search**, and sends a clean, compact newsletter straight to **Telegram**—essentially acting as a research assistant on autopilot. The post includes a downloadable workflow (`ai-newsletter-n8n`) and step-by-step instructions so you can adapt it to your own topics and setup.
