I am a Senior Data Scientist at adidas, leading the development of data-driven product recommendations and developing tools for demand time series forecasting.

Before, I was a Team Lead and Machine Learning Engineer at intive, a Postdoctoral Researcher in Data-driven System Identification at Johns Hopkins University, AI Strategist at the Smart Sensing and Electronics Department of the Fraunhofer IIS and Visiting Researcher at Princeton University.

I received my PhD from the Technical University of Munich on self-organization in systems of interacting oscillators.
