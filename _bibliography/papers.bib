  abstract =     {{We propose an approach to learn effective evolution equations for large systems of interacting agents. This is demonstrated on two examples, a well-studied system of coupled normal form oscillators and a biologically motivated example of coupled Hodgkin-Huxley-like neurons. For such types of systems there is no obvious space coordinate in which to learn effective evolution laws in the form of partial differential equations. In our approach, we accomplish this by learning embedding coordinates from the time series data of the system using manifold learning as a first step. In these emergent coordinates, we then show how one can learn effective partial differential equations, using neural networks, that do not only reproduce the dynamics of the oscillator ensemble, but also capture the collective bifurcations when system parameters vary. The proposed approach thus integrates the automatic, data-driven extraction of emergent space coordinates parametrizing the agent dynamics, with machine-learning assisted identification of an emergent PDE description of the dynamics in this parametrization.}},

  abstract =     {{We present a data-driven approach to learning surrogate models for amplitude equations and illustrate its application to interfacial dynamics of phase field systems. In particular, we demonstrate learning effective partial differential equations describing the evolution of phase field interfaces from full phase field data. We illustrate this on a model phase field system, where analytical approximate equations for the dynamics of the phase field interface (a higher-order eikonal equation and its approximation, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation) are known. For this system, we discuss data-driven approaches for the identification of equations that accurately describe the front interface dynamics. When the analytical approximate models mentioned above become inaccurate, as we move beyond the region of validity of the underlying assumptions, the data-driven equations outperform them. In these regimes, going beyond black box identification, we explore different approaches to learning data-driven corrections to the analytically approximate models, leading to effective gray box partial differential equations.}},

The scheme is based on two correlation measures that enable a meaningful definition of chimera states as well as their classification into three categories: stationary, turbulent, and breathing. In addition, these categories can be further subdivided according to the time-stationarity of these two measures. We demonstrate that this approach is both consistent with previously recognized chimera states and enables us to classify states as chimeras which have not been categorized as such before. Furthermore, the scheme allows for a qualitative and quantitative comparison of experimental chimeras with chimeras obtained through numerical simulations.}},

Exploiting the generalized synchronization concept, we argue that the converged, “mature” internal states constitute a function on this learned manifold. The dimension of this manifold then dictates the length of observed input time series data required for consistent initialization. We illustrate our approach through a partially observed chemical model system, where initializing the internal LSTM states in this fashion yields visibly improved performance. Finally, we show that learning this data manifold enables the transformation of partially observed dynamics into fully observed ones, facilitating alternative identification paths for nonlinear dynamical systems.}},

In this Letter, we investigate chaotic attractors in an ensemble of four mean-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators with two oscillators being synchronized. We report that these states with partially broken symmetry, so-called chimera states, have different setwise symmetries in the incoherent oscillators, and in particular, some are and some are not invariant under a permutation symmetry on average. This allows for a classification of different chimera states in small networks. We conclude our report with a discussion of related states in spatially extended systems, which seem to inherit the symmetry properties of their counterparts in small networks.}},
